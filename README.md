# UBB-SE-SoftwareEngineering-Assignment5
Temporary repository to be used for SE's assignment 5, with 1 common master branch and a separate branch for each contributor.

The purpose of this repository is to unify each and every test made by the team members into main.

The specific parts for everyone can be found in the Parts-Backup.txt

Deadline unknown as of friday, so most likely we'll meet again in week 12, but would rather have everything done before the start of week 11.
